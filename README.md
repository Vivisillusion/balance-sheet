# 💸 Balance Sheet Project

This project is a rage-fueled exercise in HTML and CSS layout, created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I followed each command like a war soldier under duress—line by line, property by property, until this pretty little abomination stood still and behaved.

## 📌 What It Is

A static HTML balance sheet that uses semantic tags, CSS styling, sticky headers, and some dark magic to look like something clean and presentable. No frameworks. No libraries. Just me, a tutorial, and sheer willpower.

## 🧠 What I Learned (Or Endured)

- How to structure a table semantically with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` (ugh)
- That `position: sticky` is Satan’s favorite tool
- That `class="current"` must go on the right element or everything burns
- The importance of semicolons (may they rot in hell)

## 🤬 What I Felt

I hated every second of it. It was dry, mechanical, and utterly uninspiring. But I did it anyway. And that’s why it’s here. Proof that I can build even when I don’t care. Proof that I can follow a rigid structure and still leave my mark.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Blood, tears, and caffeine withdrawal

## 🕯️ Final Thoughts

I don’t love this project. But I respect it. It was a test of endurance—not creativity—and I passed.
